# Project Approach

As a team, we decided to build our project using Agile methodology. The reason we agreed to work this way is due to the benefits Agile working provides. An example of this is how we used time-boxed sprints of two-days to deliver new features. 

As a team, we agreed to hold three daily meetings: 9:30, 14:00, 16:15, which allowed us to share an update on tickets and any blockers we were facing.

In our 9:30 stand-up, each member of the team would explain how they are feeling via an emotional check-in, what worked well yesterday, what didn't work well and what they plan to achieve today. We would also discuss open tickets and how we are feeling with the allocated workload.

In our 14:00 alignment meeting,  each member of the team would explain how they are feeling via an emotional check-in, what worked well in the morning pairing session, what didn't work well and what they plan to achieve in the afternoon. We would also discuss open tickets and how we are feeling with the allocated workload.

In our 16:30 retro, each member of the team would explain how they are feeling via an emotional check-in, what worked well in the afternoon pairing session and what didn't work well. We would discuss open tickets and collaboratively discuss the following dayâ€™s workload and pair allocation.

We agreed on two-day sprints and would use pair programming to develop our product. We rotated pairs daily so every team member could work on areas of the product and have visibility of the whole codebase. To allow all team members the opportunity to lead the project, we assigned a Scrum Master and Scribe to each sprint.

# First Sprint (MVP)

Using Agile methodology we were able to plan the build of our first MVP. As a team, we decided to focus on a product that raised awareness of current environmental issues and agreed to build a carbon footprint calculator. The calculator would provide the carbon emissions of a journey within the UK and offer alternative journeys to the user to reduce their footprint. 
To achieve clarity on what to build, why and when, we broke our product down into various user stories. This allowed us to allocate work easily and keep track of each feature.

```
As a user, I would like to visit a page that will determine the carbon output of my journey

As a user, I would like to enter a start and endpoint of my journey

As a user, I would like to choose my method of transport
```

Once we had assigned tickets we started to build our MVP.
