## The Mission

As a team we decided to focus on a product that raised awareness of current environmental issues and have built a carbon footprint calculator. The calculator provides the carbon output of a journey within the UK and offers alternative journeys to the user to reduce the footprint.

## Using this code

### This repo needs cloning and running for the back end to work correctly.
[Back End repository](https://github.com/nwmbutler/carbon-back-end)

```
clone this repo
```
```
clone the backend repo
```
[Back End repository](https://github.com/nwmbutler/carbon-back-end)

### These three instructions are identical, but perform them in backend root first, followed by the frontend.

* In the root run
```
$ npm install
```
* In the root run
```
$ npm start
```
* Start script should automatically open a new window with the react app visible,
if this doesn't open automatically navigate to localhost:3000
* To see the backend navigate to localhost:5000
