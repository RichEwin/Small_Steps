# Using this code
### This repo needs cloning and running of the back end to work correctly.
[link to Back End](https://github.com/nwmbutler/carbon-back-end)

```
clone this repo
```
```
clone [link to Back End](https://github.com/nwmbutler/carbon-back-end) into a
 different directory
 ```
### These three instructions are identical, but perform them in backend root first.

* In the root run
```
$ npm install
```
* In the root run
```
$ npm start
```
* Start script should automatically open a new window with the react app visible,
if this doesn't open automatically navigate to localhost:3000
* To see the backend navigate to localhost:5000
